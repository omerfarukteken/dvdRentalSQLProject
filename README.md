Overview

In this project, you will use PostgreSQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. 
You will write SQL code to run SQL queries and answer interesting questions about the database. 
As part of your project you will run SQL queries and build visualizations to showcase the output of your queries.


The project is a presentation, for the presentation component, you will create four slides. Each slide will:

Have a question 
Have a supporting SQL query needed to answer the question.
Have a supporting visualization created using the final data of your SQL query that answers the question.


A set of slides with a question, visualization, and small summary on each slide. A text file with your queries needed to answer each of the four questions.

Questions
